# BakeLight

**AI-Accelerated Modular Path Tracer for Blender**

BakeLight is a next-generation Blender addon and standalone renderer that combines the power of PyTorch, CUDA acceleration, and advanced AI techniques (GANs, diffusion models) to deliver blazing-fast, high-quality path tracing for artists, researchers, and developers.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- **Physically-Based Path Tracing** — Realistic lighting for simple and complex scenes
- **PyTorch & CUDA Acceleration** — Leverages GPU for maximum speed
- **AI-Driven Sampling** — GAN/diffusion-based path prediction for faster convergence
- **Modular Design** — Clean, extensible architecture for easy feature addition
- **Blender Integration** — Seamless workflow as a Blender addon
- **Open Source** — Built for the community, by the community
